# ODI-Players-Runs-Scraper
I have scraped the names of players from Wikipedia by using the python Wikipedia API.

Then I used Selenium to navigate http://stats.espncricinfo.com by putting the name of player from players list scraped from Wikipedia and scraping the runs of each players by BeautifulSoup. Although the script can fetch runs of all the players (about 2600), I have fetched runs of 200 players and cumulated them as it is taking time. Once reviewed I will also fetch the runs of remaining players. Data is 100% accurate.
